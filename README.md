## Introduction

The real estate market in Bangalore, India, is booming, and accurate prediction of house prices is essential for both buyers and sellers. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on various features like location, size, amenities, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about houses in Bangalore, including features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities, etc. The dataset is available publicly and can be found [here](link-to-dataset).

## Preprocessing

Before building the machine learning models, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, etc. These steps ensure that the data is in a suitable format for model training.

## Model Building

Several machine learning algorithms were experimented with, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. The models were trained and evaluated using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to ensure optimal performance.

## Evaluation

The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared score. These metrics provide insights into how well the models are able to predict house prices.

## Deployment

The trained machine learning model can be deployed in various ways, such as a web application, API, or integrated into a real estate platform. Deployment allows users to make predictions on house prices using the trained model.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kruthikgoud/bengaluru_house_price.git
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script to train the model: `python train.py`
4. Use the trained model to make predictions: `python predict.py`
